Lazada is the go-to online shopping platform for Southeast Asia. Lazada operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam and therefore has a potential market reach of around 600 million consumers. Lazada was founded in 2012 and is a subsidiary of Alibaba Group.

With Clienkâ€™s integration for Lazada, companies can add Lazada stores as customer service channels. You can mix and match with all other customer service channels that Clienk has integrated, and your agents will be able to handle all the customer service requests in one single interface. You can configure skill-based workload balancing based on your team structure or preferences. From the perspective of a single queue sessions are added based on your priority preference and distributed to your agents based on their workload settings. You can add multiple Lazada stores to your setup.

The integration to Clienk is activated by a simple web-based authorization procedure after your store has been set up in Lazada and is in operation. We offer free assistance in authorizing Clienk to your Lazada store(s).
