XpertHealth Customer Service team is based in Shanghai and the Netherlands. They work with different time zones, allowing them to engage with more and more users.

Clienk's platform helps both teams to:

\1. **Combine** users and inquiries coming from **different channels** the website live chat, their WeChat mini-program, and their Cory.Care APP **into one single platform**.

\2. **Simplify the workflow** for health Xperts (no need for the team to use an own private WeChat anymore, everything is centralized into one single platform)

\3. Use **surveys to get real-time feedback** after each chat.

4.Simplify the workflow to **answer** health-related customer questions and to connect them to the XpertHealth network

**Why mini-program?**

Xperthealth's objective is to localize and integrate with the user's environment.

With mini-programs they can combine their consulting services with intelligent offerings of health-related products, sports equipment, services, etc.

Communication is professional and streamlined, and it helps new users understanding better what XpertHealth provides.

**Simplified workflow**

**Both teams can follow up on consumers' requirements and reach out individually, check visitor’s profiles and conversation history, as well as follow the complete customer journey from the first time they contacted XpertHealth.**

**Powerful insights**

**With access to the entire user's conversation history among the different channels, no information is lost or repeated, and this clarity of data provides powerful insights and improve engagement with the customer.**

It helps a lot for our work since all the communication channels we have are connected to one single platform, with consumers' profiles and chat history. I find quick-replies very helpful, especially when it comes to dealing with a lot of incoming messages.
