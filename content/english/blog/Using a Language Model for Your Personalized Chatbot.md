Here at Clienk, we have been working with conversational AI for quite some time now. Since its inception, we have witnessed the evolution of conversational AI from simple chatbots to sophisticated virtual assistants that can understand natural language and carry out complex tasks. In recent months, we have implemented OpenAI's large language model, ChatGPT, on top of our already-implemented AI providers like Google Dialogflow, IBM Watson, RASA, and Fano.ai.

We are thrilled to report that the results are astounding. With Clienk AI, you can teach the language model about your company's products, services, and information, and also utilize it for human interactions with your customers, whether it be through voice, email, or messages. The preliminary results show that with proper content and backend integration, a resolve rate or first contact resolution (FCR) of more than 75% can be achieved, and that too for 24 hours a day! All of this can be achieved without in-depth training, which was previously required for conversational AI. The language model will distill the correct answers from the unstructured information you have fed it.

**How language models work**

GPT models have made headlines for their ability to produce human-like text with remarkable accuracy. ChatGPT, specifically, has been trained on a massive amount of text data, allowing it to generate responses that are not only grammatically correct but also contextually relevant. Essentially, ChatGPT learned from the vast amount of data that has been fed into it, and as a result, it can understand the context of the conversation and generate responses accordingly.

**Implementing Clienk AI for Your Business**

To implement Clienk AI for your business, you will need to provide it with an amount of relevant data. This data could include product descriptions, FAQ pages, customer reviews, previous conversations and any other information that might be useful for your customers. Once you have provided the data, your chatbot will be able to generate responses based on the customer's queries.

The beauty of Clienk AI is that it does not require any additional training or programming to understand new queries. As long as the data you provide is relevant, Clienk AI will be able to generate accurate responses.

## Benefits of Using Clienk AI for Your Business

**Enhanced Customer Service**
Clienk AI can handle a high volume of customer queries simultaneously, which means that your customers will receive prompt responses to their queries. This leads to improved customer satisfaction and a higher likelihood of repeat business.

**Increased Efficiency**
With Clienk AI handling the majority of customer queries, your support staff will be able to focus on more complex issues that require human intervention. This leads to increased efficiency and productivity for your support team.

**Cost-Effective**
Hiring and training human support staff can be a significant expense for any business. With Clienk AI, you can provide your customers with a high level of support at a fraction of the cost of hiring and training human staff.

**24/7 Availability**
Clienk AI is available 24/7, which means that your customers can get their queries resolved at any time of the day or night. This is particularly useful for businesses that operate in different time zones.

**Security and Privacy Concerns**
It is important to note that the data you provide to Clienk AI is kept on your or our private cloud and is not used for training the language model. This means that your company's content remains secure and confidential. Additionally, the data is only used for your company's chatbot solution, which means that your and your customers personal data is not shared with any third-party organizations.

## Concluding

Clienk AI is a game-changer for businesses looking to provide better customer service while also reducing costs. By providing Clienk AI with relevant data, you can create a personalized chatbot that can handle a high volume of customer queries, provide prompt responses, and increase customer satisfaction. With a resolve rate of over 75%, Clienk AI is an incredibly efficient and effective solution for businesses of all sizes.
